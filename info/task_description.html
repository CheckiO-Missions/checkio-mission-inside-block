<p>
    When it comes to city planning it's important to understand the borders of various city structures.
    Parks, lakes or living blocks can be represented as closed polygon and can be described using
    cartesian coordinates on a map. We need a functionality to determine if a point (a building or a
    tree) lies inside the structure.

</p>
<p>
    For the purpose of this mission, a city structure may be considered a polygon represented as a
    sequence of vertex coordinates on a plane or map. The vertices are connected sequentially with
    the last vertex in the list connecting to the first. We are given the coordinates of the point
    which we need to check. If the point of impact lies on the edge of the polygon then it should be
    considered inside of it. For this mission, you need to determine whether the given point lies
    inside the polygon.

    For example, on the left image you see a polygon which is described by
    [[2, 1], [1, 5],[5, 7], [7, 7], [7, 2]] and the point at [2, 7]. The result is False.<br>
    For the right image the point lies on the edge and gets counted as inside the polygon,
    making the result True.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments. Polygon coordinates as a list of lists with two
    integers each.
    A checking point coordinates as a list of two integers.</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> Whatever the point inside the polygon or not as a boolean.</p>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept is using for image recognizing. But as we said early it can be useful
    for topographical software and city planning.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
